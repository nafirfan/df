Its too cliche and too much drama for nothing for example at the beginning. It just doesnt feel right and real. Just for the sake of drama the characters seem to say and do things to build tension. Feels to rushed. The romance happens way to fast - One minute she is pissed all the time and doesn&apos;t respect him at all, the next minute... Nothing is really authentic, except when he starts to sing! They tried to hard to put as much drama as possible into it. The only thing missing was a deadly illness...\n\nI really wanted to love the movie, to feel with the characters , but it was just average. A film for cozy sundays. Could have been so much more.

It felt as if i was watching a Disney / Pixar grade film. Everything exceeded my expectations to be honest. Don&apos;t listen to what other say about this movie.

The choice of music was super and really felt what the producers wanted us to feel when watching the movie. My eyes 👀 got a little blurry, if you know what i mean .

To make matters worse, his dad owed money to a lot of companies, and owed a substantial amount to Odilon ((Evandro Mesquita), the film&apos;s antagonist.\n\nUnable to settle the debt, Odilon offers Roger a job as a getaway driver, stealing cargo from other trucks.

And Heart in the Right Place.\n\nIn the film, Paula (Loes Luca) and Johan (Gijs de Lange) decide to go to Bonaire to the Pension Casa Coco run by their old friend Pleun (Joke Bruijs). This time they decided to take their other friend Toon (Gerard Cox) with them after his divorce as well. The problem is that Pleun and Toon are ex-lover of each other and they haven&apos;t seen each other for years. This coming together can only add to the awkwardness between the two.\n\nThis film is the third film that Bob Wilbers has directed in the same year. This crowds are still due to the corona pandemic of recent years. Casa Coco would otherwise have been released in cinemas earlier. Despite this delay, this film unfortunately brings little new compared to other Dutch romantic comedies. The film could actually have been put on a streaming service such as Videoland before, because to actually see this film in the cinema now, it is actually not really worth the film. The three writers of the film are also more known for writing standard Dutch romantic comedies and unfortunately have not really created anything special with this new film.\n\nThe story is a bit messy and contains too many different characters. There is almost no real clear story in the film. The film also becomes more filled with the different stories of all the different characters, who are more mindful of their own business. There is talk about a history between some characters, but this is not really clearly portrayed, so this doesn&apos;t really interest you as a viewer. If the film itself had had fewer characters and the remaining characters had been given a clearer background, the film would have come across more clearly with characters that the viewer cares about a bit more. Aside from the messy story, this remains on the predictable side. As a viewer you can roughly expect where the story is going and what is going to happen. This way you can keep ahead of the story, which only makes for a long-winded feeling.\n\nThanks to the standard story and the amount of characters, most of the film cast also have few opportunities to do anything special with their roles. The various characters remain each other, but overshadow with their own storylines. The chemistry between the many couples does not come across as really romantic and sometimes even feels a bit more forced.

A lynch pin holding much together, he was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most -Renee is good in her role, strong, fair, engaging, and dare I say just a great character that acts not just as a goal, but an engaging character mode. She&apos;s got sass, vulnerability, and yet compassion that makes for a strong character.\n\n-Ben Wang is more of the comedic relief, but not in the stumbling boob, gigantic joke that these roles can take on. He&apos;s again realistic, fun, great timing, but also holds more past the jokes in his goal to make this quest for identity better.\n\n-As for Li, he&apos;s got the most extremes of character, which is kind of the point, but outside of trying to be overly cool, it works with the symphony of feelings that play out in this journey.\n\n-There is hurt, questions being asked, but also recognition and heart, and to do that in such a young age, again for Disney in the modern era, tough to achieve, but he did it.\n\n-And the chemistry works very well, a believable relationship built between these people that throws so much story in it instead of the political topics being the center.\n\nPacing -The movie may not be the most exciting at times, as expected of a coming of age tale, but it does work and still move to be engaging.\n\n-Chang&apos;s journey has the fun moments, the no so fun moments, and the balanced moments that all work themselves into an order that remained intriguing to me.\n\n-And throw in the entertainment values in this movie, even the slower parts had good time awareness and seemed catered to telling this tale and never losing just having fun.\n\nThe Process and Journey -When it comes to a character working towards a goal... you know it&apos;s all about the journey to get there and not just the end game.\n\n-And this movie does a fantastic job of bring you into that process, in my opinion.\n\n-We&apos;ve got montages of training that of course are cliché and expected of this movie, but with the music, the editing with the sound/commentary, and breaking it up moments... it feels fresh and fun.\n\n-Throw in the fact that there is a documentary/video making approach to the film, and it adds this modern relativity to it that dare I say makes it better in my opinion.\n\n-And again, it has these nuances that multigenerational approaches can enjoy and respect, but never loses the fun moment, even when things take a slower journey -That&apos;s right, even the back half of the film where things change has a process that is respectable, and kind of shows a more realistic approach to character development than what Disney often does.\n\n-That again helps tie the movie down to the grounded moment and keep focus, and makes these harder moments believable, engaging, and quite honestly more impactful.\n\n-That is a beautiful thing to keep me entertained during slower moments.\n\n-The Humor -Chang&apos;s dunking journey may have some in your face moments that are cringe worthy, but a lot of it just feels very natural and fun.\n\n-Klutzes like me, will enjoy the slapstick stumbling as he works on getting in shape, appreciating the falls with a purpose vs. Falls for being dumb.\n\n-The one-liners and stings are timed well, and pulled in at the right times, alongside the awkward banter that arises with the use of this stuff.\n\n-And the fact that it gives you time to reset and enjoy the variety is smart, allowing the humor to be a topping, not the whole movie, which is very impressive in my opinion.\n\nThe Overall Morals Of The Story -The movie is of course a Disney coming of age tale, and that means we probably need to learn something.\n\n-And this movie accomplishes much of this with lessons that actually are logical, balanced, and not so extreme like so many of their projects are.\n\n-It helps with identity searching without so much entitlement and empowerment to the point of toxic movements.\n\n-It conveys realistic growth and just how fallible we are, but doesn&apos;t paint anyone a major enemy to do it, but rather shows how the character struggles.\n\n-And it teaches so much about the hard work that comes when things hit the fan. It&apos;s beautiful the way it works out and really shows how a story can be developed and be amazing.\n\nThe Music -It&apos;s a powerful track list that brings so much with it in regards to the utility and feelings that a good song can bring.\n\n-Knowing most of the songs, the nostalgic factor is of course fun and inspiring to have a blast to your own achievements and memories.\n\n-And yet, the selection again works well to go with the feeling of the scene and really deliver the punch that would be gone without it. Such a great use of music.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nA Tad Hokey at Times -This is hard to achieve, but the movie does dive a bit into the preachy hokey moments that make families go AWWWWWW.\n\n-They are few and far between, and often avoid getting too monologue like, and I like that it&apos;s not too in your face.\n\n-When you do that, it works so well that even the veering into the lanes don&apos;t throw me off too much to be too upset.\n\nSome Character Development That Needed Some Time -Some things get a little short sighted, and some moments could have had more heat, time, and a scene or two to integrate.\n\n-Yet again, most of the characters and areas they had to approach, were again stellar in their handling and even these missing moments were not quite as missed in the grand scheme because of the stronger moments.\n\n-The finish might have needed just a little more time for the full kick for me, but again, I&apos;m being nitpicky on this particular area.\n\nA Tad Longer Than Probably Needed with The Content -Given the direction they took, it felt a tad long at times, a few moments maybe a bit more dragged out to get cameos in or throw that one moment into the mix.\n\n-But again, I can&apos;t say there was a lot of dead time either, and so reducing by like 10-15 minutes might have put this at the right time, unless they had made more time with the other characters.\n\nPredictable For The Most Part -I mean, this was not one of those unique stories that revolutionizes the movie world, so as such, the twist factor is pretty minimal.\n\n-And even though I know where this is going and can see where things are going to fall, it still has enough entertainment and class with it, that the predictability is not the full run over that other movies do.\n\n-Therefore, again, this movie may not be the most original, mind blowing, or dare I say top notch sports movie, but that heart helps things out.\n\nThe VERDICT: To my surprise, this Disney original film really works for me and feels like the time back in the 90s and 2000s when Disney knew how to have fun, tell stories, and make entertaining stories. Chang Can Dunk shows how to take real life issues, but wrap them in engaging, natural and fun stories that help break away from the drudges of reality. I loved the movements of earnest focus, and the way the acting/characters blend well to teach the lessons and not make me hate what I&apos;m learning. It drops so much of the entitlement and superiority and instead focuses on just being real and constructive. I loved the jokes, I loved the montages, and again the music has such power behind the familiar strands. Sure the movie is not perfect in all its endeavors. It&apos;s not the most unique tale, and it does not match things and characters perfectly, but I also don&apos;t think it veered too far. So that leaves me with the following scores and recommendations to see this movie:\n\nDrama/Family/Sport: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}",3.2,PG,"['Drama', 'Family', 'Sport']",2023-03-10,"basketball sport,high school,basketball,friend,teenager",PT1H49M,"[{'name': 'Bloom Li', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8508407/'}, {'name': 'Ben Wang', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12213794/'}, {'name': 'Zoe Renee', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6312506/'}]","[{'name': 'Jingyi Shao', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3545922/'}]","[{'name': 'Jingyi Shao', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3545922/'}]",3.7,4.75

In EL CONDE (The Count), Larrain makes Pinochet a literal monster: A vampire who, even after death, is still sucking the soul out of the Chilean people.\n\nLarrain, working with frequent screenplay collaborator Guillermo Calderon, has fashioned a true horror film. Gory and full of grotesque scenes, but, at it&apos;s core, it&apos;s a pitch black satire. It&apos;s not the first time that Larrain has taken such a fanciful tack with a &apos;bio-pic&apos;, his fabulous 2016 NERUDA turned the life of the namesake poet into a Film Noir thriller. EL CONDE is narrated in English and compactly traces Pinochet from his youth 250 years prior in France to his reign in Chile from 1973 to 1990 (Pinochet actually did have family roots tracing back to France). The bulk of the story takes place in the years after his official death (2006). Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is living in a decaying old mansion with his long-time right hand man and butler, Fyodor (Alfredo Castro) and his less than loving wife Lucia (Gloria Munchmeyer). Pinochet&apos;s brood of ingrate children have gathered to divy up the family fortune which, in true dictator style, was largely stolen. An accountant, Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger), has been summoned to oversee the financial skulduggery. Carmencita is a nun and she functions as the &apos;Van Helsing&apos; of the piece. She&apos;s also doubles as an Exorcist of sorts.\n\nThe movie is shot exquisitely in Black & White by the great Ed Lachman (CAROL, VIRGIN SUICIDES). Lachman&apos;s work truly ascends when the Count takes flight sweeping over the landscape like a dark overlord. A later, first flight of a vampire, is one of the most soaring sights in a film this year. The sound work here is exceptional with a surround sound symphony of creaking floors and rotting detritus. The classically based music score adds to the gloom and doom. Visually, Larrain and Lachman make references to films such as Carl Dreyer&apos;s JEANNE D&apos;ARC (Actress Luchsinger bears a striking resemblance to Falconetti) and VAMPYR. This count isn&apos;t content to just drink the blood of his victims - he consumes their very hearts as well.\n\nThe theme of vampirism is an obvious metaphor, but Larrain handles it well, with delicious dark touches. Still, he can&apos;t help but let things get a bit too fanciful and drags in everything from Marie Antoinette to the Falklands war to a surprise cameo. It muddies things up a bit and extends the allegory a bit too thin, even as it strikes a strong blow about the permanence of evil.\n\nEL CONDE is a stirring movie, that doesn&apos;t fully hit its marks, but it does so with masterly style and intellectual vigor.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': None, 'bestRating': None, 'ratingValue': None}}",3.25,R,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'History']",2023-09-15,"male frontal nudity,male full frontal nudity,satire comedy,satirical comedy,violence",PT1H50M,"[{'name': 'Jaime Vadell', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0882994/'}, {'name': 'Gloria Münchmeyer', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618416/'}, {'name': 'Alfredo Castro', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0998846/'}]","[{'name': 'Pablo Larraín', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883257/'}]","[{'name': 'Guillermo Calderón', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5979724/'}, {'name': 'Pablo Larraín', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883257/'}]",3.25,4.1

Jon Karthaus also plays a character in this film.\n\nIn the film, family members go with their partners and demented father to the French Burgundy, where they used to go as a family. This time they gather here for a memorial weekend and will scatter the ashes of their deceased brother and friend here.\n\nWhen Evelien (Lisa Zweerman) arrives too late with her new love Bram (Kay Greidanus), an uneasy atmosphere suddenly arises between everyone. Despite this atmosphere, as family and friends they just try to continue their traditions for one last time. This time everything is just different than they were used to.\n\nWith this movie, Jon Karthaus and the rest of the movie cast and crew seem to have come up with the idea for this movie together. In addition to Jon Karthaus, others from the film cast also co-wrote the story of the final film. For some of them this is only their first writing. For others who have written something before in the front of a film, this writing also remains a bit on the starting side. The fact that a story has been written with four people, some of whom are still on the inexperienced side, can be seen in the film itself. Many things like the characters or events are not given a clear background or further explanation. For example, you hardly know what everyone&apos;s relationship is, or what the rules are for the different games they play together. For example, it sometimes seems as if you are looking at holiday images of strange people that you do not know yourself.\n\nThis film is also reminiscent of a comedy made by actor Adam Sandler. With his Grown Ups films, for example, he would take befriended actors to a beautiful place to have the film played here, but otherwise he made little effort to really make something beautiful or comical of these films. Just like in such films of his, the most laughed is also by the film cast themselves in this film. The comedy of the film is much on the predictable or forced side, so there is not really much to laugh about anymore. The story itself is also a bit odd and sloppy. Characters often make separate decisions at the wrong moments, so that as a viewer, despite the fact that the film is a comedy, it is sometimes difficult to take it seriously. Many of these strange decisions seem unrealistic.\n\nDue to the lack of explanation and the separate actions that the characters sometimes undergo, the acting does not come out so strongly. Only when you learn about the relationships between the different characters later in the film can you better understand why they react to certain things the way they do. On the other hand, it does create extra discomfort between the characters and for you as a viewer.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.7,0,['Comedy'],2023-01-19,"female topless nudity,outdoor nudity,public nudity,friendship,death of a friend",PT1H29M,"[{'name': 'Ludwig Bindervoet', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2807735/'}, {'name': 'Sarah Chronis', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2457706/'}, {'name': 'Steef de Bot', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6024583/'}]","[{'name': 'Jon Karthaus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670246/'}]","[{'name': 'Kay Greidanus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340028/'}, {'name': 'Jon Karthaus', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670246/'}, {'name': 'Lisa Zweerman', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4313760/'}]",2.05,0.5

It&apos;s a lot of fun, exciting, has a good amount of energy, has the right amount of horror to not put the kids off it and just makes you smile. So I was glad to see that the love for it gave birth to a long awaited sequel.\n\nWith the excitement comes the caution as sequels from 80&apos;s or 90&apos;s originals have a low success rate. But like with something like &apos;Top Gun: Maverick&apos; I knew that in the right hands if they committed to the concept rather than try and make it contemporary to keep the interest of modern audiences, then this could be as fun as the original.\n\nThere is a promising start that will certainly engage the fans of the original and while the structure as a whole is very familiar, it still never felt like cash grab. There was enough to keep the story going while paying homage to its predecessor which is fine as that is the reason why this film finally exists.\n\nThe action isn&apos;t really as physical as before. But as a few of our stars are a bit seasoned now, some of the changes that they made to accommodate that never made the film drag for me.\n\nThe finale is certainly the film&apos;s high point as there is one moment that will get the fans emotional. It certainly caught me off guard. It left me very satisfied, and I think it will get a strong positive response with other loyal members of the fandom also.\n\nSeeing the trio of Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker was just great. They have not lost their touch or chemistry and Midler in particular can still put on a great show. It never felt they were phoning it in. It felt like they wanted to give something back to the fans which was wholly satisfying. It was also great seeing Doug Jones return. Jones is someone that does not get enough credit from people outside of the industry. You probably don&apos;t realise how much work Jones has done and his signature physical acting was put to good use once again.\n\nAs for the new cast, they weren&apos;t as instantly likable as the ones from the original. But they did a perfectly functional job to help the story move along and were thankfully never annoying.\n\nIt was great seeing parts of the original locations used and bringing back John Debney for that memorable score to be put to use once again. Some parts did look a bit too polished, too much like a set and never felt as dirty or authentic as its predecessor. The pacing is solid but could have been a bit more rampant to give it some adrenaline. The slightly longer running time doesn&apos;t help.\n\nOther minor negatives to speak of was that the stakes never felt that big or consequential. I&apos;m not totally surprised at this as Disney don&apos;t try to make things too scary or risky these days.\n\nBut that being said, the fun factor and energy is still there and despite its flaws I had a blast watching this. As a fan, it was great to see the gang bang together. While some of the nods, call backs and gags didn&apos;t all work, they largely were well executed. For non-fans, I feel this will remain a pleasurable watch. It does a good job celebrating its legacy and never tarnishing it. The emotional and highly satisfying finale proved that they were basically saying thank you to the fans for celebrating the original for so long.\n\nI really hope I&apos;m not the minority as I try to avoid seeing beloved projects through tinted eyes. But I think as a film it&apos;s perfectly fine with some nice moments that anyone can be invested in. But this will clearly satisfy the fans.\n\nI must mention that there is a post credits scene. It&apos;s hard to not give a hint without spoiling it. So that&apos;s all say about it.

The plot tries to place the pandemic as a relevant factor, to the point of counting the days of confinement at the time when curfews and quarantines came into effect worldwide; the pandemic context seems to be just an artifice to attract an audience; the plot would remain the same without the pandemic.\n\nIn the end, the feeling is one of exploitation, a twist that feels forced. Nothing in the plot indicates that that would be the end, the plot just plays a trick, an Ex-Machina that connects all the points, leaving us with the bitter taste of disassociation. The insinuations, the theories, all falls flat.\n\nThe name of the film can only be premeditated. Infest.\n\nWith a linear and simplistic plot, marked by a meaningless and calculated twist, and appropriating a historical moment that does not interfere with the plot, Infiesto should only be proud of its sepia cinematography of a decrepit Spanish region. The atmosphere is tense and suffocating, but the story is thin.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 5}}",2.8,TV-MA,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",2023-02-03,"covid 19,coronavirus,pandemic,cop drama,detective",PT1H36M,"[{'name': 'Isak Férriz', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1929945/'}, {'name': 'Iria del Río', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4170579/'}, {'name': 'Antonio Buíl', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125663/'}]","[{'name': 'Patxi Amezcua', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025538/'}]","[{'name': 'Patxi Amezcua', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025538/'}]",2.1,4.15

Justice. Forgiveness. Freedom.', 'reviewBody': 'Agatha gets invited to join her sister Olivia&apos;s yacht party along with several other elite people. Agatha is a crime enthusiast and runs her own podcast. On the yacht, Olivia reveals the one of her guest won&apos;t make it back to the shore and that they will have contemplate their lives up until then as that boat ride could be their last. As they are woken up to a thud leading to a dead Olivia in the high seas, it is upto Agatha to solve the mystery and catch the culprit. How she does that forms rest of the story.\n\nThe film gets derailed once the on screen death happens and it barely gives enough to buy into the mystery. Since the whole reveal was about delivering the what the flower stood for, let me try to put forth my analogy in those terms..\n\n1. Love = The makers feel the bunch of characters they have are enough to pull off this story. But there is literal lack of bonding between then especially Agatha and Olivia, who are sisters while there is a mention of loss of a loved one that got them distant but, the death of Olivia barely gets any emotion out of Agatha who at best is an amateur crime enthusiast solving the mystery in an hackneyed manner. There is enough love for the genre but nothing transcends onto the screen.\n\n2. Justice = The whole reveal has this as a major aim i.e. Get justice to the deserving. Sadly, the writing denies it as the reveal itself is far from convicinving and the way it is narrated, just complicates it further when seen from a broad perspective, the crime was pretty much over simplified as it is and so were the main suspects.\n\n3. Forgiveness = It is a bit hard to but as an audience, will have to forgive the makers for a bland product. For all the talk about able to forgive and move on, among the characters, it comes way too late and hardly has any impact.\n\n4. Freedom = the film ended and the instant feeling I got was, well Freedom. Not that I kept comparing it with the recent murder mystery films including the Knives Out, but the weak writing made this a tiresome experience, enough to feel free once the film ended. Also, there was no need to show the police as so dummies, glad they were free to from this case in the end.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 3}}",2.55,TV-14,"['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",2023-10-06,"murder,sister,husband wife relationship,dark comedy,revenge",PT1H32M,"[{'name': 'Maribel Verdú', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893941/'}, {'name': 'Stephanie Cayo', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147310/'}, {'name': 'Regina Blandón', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1566368/'}]","[{'name': 'J.M Cravioto', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1458283/'}]","[{'name': 'Javier Durán Pérez', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14069137/'}, {'name': 'Anton Goenechea', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6918567/'}, {'name': 'Carmen Posadas', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692604/'}]",4.55,5.0

And we never really know how he got there or why the villain chose that as his headquarters but there we are, disbelief suspended, rooting for our hero. The malevolent villain in his malevolent fortress surrounded by malevolent underlings. But - and this is important - we expected that from Bond. After all, the ENTIRE WORLD was at stake. And what better to bring down the world than a fortress?\n\nIn &apos;Luther: The Fallen Sun&apos;, the entire world is not at stake. Given, a lot of innocent people do die, but does our villain really need a faraway fortress? No, of course not. But &apos;Luther&apos;s ...&apos; got one. And, if actor Idris Elba were auditioning to be the next Bond, it would make sense to have the film&apos;s climax at that fortress. It would make sense for Luther - like Bond in Casino Royale - to be tied up and tortured at that fortress. It would make sense for Luther - like Bond - to battle the bureaucracy and have it&apos;s female head - like Bond&apos;s &apos;M&apos; - become an important ally. Yes, at that fortress.\n\nThis Luther is unlike any that came before. And that is a bad thing, make no mistake. Do not go into this looking for London, or grit, or romance, or anything that made Luther, &apos;Luther&apos;. In one early scene we see Luther posing atop a skyscraper, the camera rolling back from him, showing him off as a Batman-like super hero. Which, as we Luther fans know, he is not.\n\nPeople are being killed all over London. What do they all have in common? Only Luther can figure it out. And he does. And we have no idea &apos;how&apos;. He just does. Down to the most minute detail. He just does. And the &apos;who&apos; behind the killings; he figures that out as well, and with ridiculous ease.\n\nLuther is jailed early in the film (a totally unnecessary plot development). Why? The answer is vague but he does escape jail with - yes - ridiculous ease. And like every stereotypical thriller, locating the villain becomes personal. In this case it&apos;s the female head of police - like Bond&apos;s &apos;M&apos; - who is imperiled.\n\nI could go on. There&apos;s the whole Norway &apos;business&apos; .... but enough.

The recipient of the best salesperson award is Max, who we follow throughout the film.\n\nIn essence the film is almost a de-evolution of Max&apos;s beliefs. In the beginning he is very pro-company and really believes in what they are doing in the most altruistic sense, which is part of what makes him a great salesperson...visiting refugees in a refugee camp and convincing young refugees to donate just 5-10 years for the money to help their entire families immigrate. When his doctor wife is forced to give up 40 years after their home is burnt down...he starts to see things from a different perspective. Meanwhile there is an activist group who believes so strongly against this company and it&apos;s practices that they are willing to commit violent crimes like murder.\n\nInteresting from a psychological perspective, I enjoyed this German Sci-fi film...not as much as I enjoyed the Dark series, but I did enjoy it.

We only got Jungle Book as the only one worth watching, everything else are either decent or just okay. Now the movie is released, I can already see a good reason people will debate this and the 2019 Lion King. The 2022 Pinocchio remake may not be the worst Disney Plus film, but this could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. There are Pinocchio movies out there that do try to find a way to tell the story of the character well. But this is more of a recycled film from the original 1940 one. Despite it does have some of the performances that&apos;s fateful to the original film, it had a weak execution with a poorly written story, mediocre characters, overly dark setups, and awful looking visuals. The one thing I&apos;ll say the visuals got right is with Pinocchio himself. But for the most part, they can be out of place and most of the designs try way too hard to make animal characters realistic. I mean, we already gotten Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale. What more do you want to do all that in, Disney Plus? Of course as a painfully pointless live action Disney remake, I recommend to skip this one and stick with the original film. But you know what, let&apos;s all be thankful at least we&apos;re getting the one by Del Toro at the end of the year. When that gets released, I can guarantee it will be the one you&apos;d want to watch instead.

Colman Domingo plays the role of Rustin -- he will without doubt be a nominee for best actor. Surprise cast (to me): Chris Rock played Roy Wilkins and gave a wonderful performance. One highlight of our showing: the presentation opened with a video appearance and introduction by one of the executive producers: Barack Obama. Obama was a real producer and was even involved in review of the script. As President, he posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is a Netflix production (overseeing several production companies) so you can see it later this year. You may think you know ahead of time what this movie will be, but trust me: you don&apos;t.

It&apos;s gleefully OTT, the screen painted red with the blood of the guilty. The foursome -- Topan (Abimana Aryasatya), Jenggo (Arie Kriting), Alpha (Lutesha) and Pelor (Kristo Immanuel) -- have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father Petrus, whose real daughter, policewoman Dina (Putri Marino), has no idea about her dad&apos;s other &apos;children&apos;.\n\nThree years later, Petrus is murdered, and Dina investigates, discovering her father&apos;s secret...\n\nThe comedy kicks in when Dina encounters her &apos;brothers and sister&apos;, who have now retired from the killing business, and the film suffers for it, the silliness being more irritating than funny.

The film is also based on the book of the same name written by Isa Hoes, who based the book on a personal experience from her life.\n\nThe couple Bastiaan (Egbert Jan Weeber) and Esther (Noortje Herlaar) are both well-known actors from the 90s. In the eyes of the world and their fans, they seem to be leading a perfect life.\n\nBehind the scenes, everything is less beautiful than it seems, because despite his success, Bastiaan suffers from a psychological depression, which is increasingly affecting his relationship with Esther and their children. Esther tries to keep Bastiaan and their family on track, but independently this takes more effort and energy than she had expected.\n\nBen Verbong tries to make a comeback as a Dutch director and scriptwriter with this film, but his last Dutch film work in which he performed these tasks was with the 1991 film The indecent woman. Unfortunately, the time between this transition falls back on this film. To see.\n\nThe story is not really clear thanks to the storytelling. In the beginning, the film shows how the film will approximately end. This can no longer be a secret for book readers or people who are familiar with the situation on which Isa Hoes has based her book. However, for people who are not familiar with this, the end of the film is given away so quickly as if they have only read the last pages of the book. As a result, the structure of the story loses some of its tension moments.\n\nThe film also focuses more on the consequences of the main character&apos;s depression, so that the cause sometimes seems a bit unclear. Due to the lack of the reasons for this cause, the main character is sometimes difficult to follow or understand. This makes the film difficult to follow at times, so it can sometimes come across as a bit long-winded. If there had been a better balance between the cause and effect of the depression, the film could have come across better. Furthermore, the film is unfortunately also filled with clichés from drama films where the depressed character is alone in the rain, for example.\n\nNoortje Herlaar tries to carry the film as the caring partner and mother, but due to separate decisions from the story, her character sometimes comes across as a bit unrealistic. Esther and Bastiaan find out about Bastiaan&apos;s depression later in the film, but they don&apos;t really take solutions for this, because Bastiaan doesn&apos;t want this. You would expect more help and control from real lovers. In emotional scenes you can sometimes also see or hear that Noortje Herlaar is crying more actingly here, so that credibility can be lost somewhat.\n\nEgbert Jan Weeber also tries to come across as someone who suffers from psychotic depression, but due to the lack of information about the cause of this depression, he is sometimes difficult to follow. When you learn a little more about the cause later in the film, it can come across as a bit weak as the real reason for his depression. After all, in addition to the depression, the main character simply has a good career history, is married with children and lives a nice life. For the reasons of his depression, you would expect that someone would be able to find the right way to avoid problems in his situations.', 'reviewRating': {'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 4}}",3.4,0,['Drama'],2023-03-02,"female nudity,brief male frontal nudity,suicide,beach,car keys",PT1H58M,"[{'name': 'Noortje Herlaar', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3794060/'}, {'name': 'Egbert Jan Weeber', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917224/'}, {'name': 'Hanne Arendzen', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4458015/'}]","[{'name': 'Ben Verbong', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893676/'}]","[{'name': 'Ger Beukenkamp', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079560/'}, {'name': 'Isa Hoes', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388578/'}, {'name': 'Sytze Van Der Laan', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479258/'}]",3.15,1.65
